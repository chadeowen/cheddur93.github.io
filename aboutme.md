### my history

Hi, I'm Chad Owen, a San Francisco Technology and Life Sciences consultant who quit his job to pursue Data Science.

Studying the cash and equity compensation environment taught me how to analyze big data. Growing up in a family with entrepreneurs gave me the courage to step away from the security of my first job and to pursue code, statistics, and mathematics. 

I am now a Data Science and Machine Learning student at The Lambda School, a Google-backed coding school, expanding my skillset as I begin my search for a career in the blockchain, crypto, or financial technology industries.
